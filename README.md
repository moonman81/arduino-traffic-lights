# Arduino Traffic Light Controller with Ontological Requirements Analysis

## 🚦 Ultra-Detailed Traffic Light System with Formal Safety Verification

This repository contains a comprehensive Arduino-based traffic light control system that has been subjected to rigorous ontological analysis and formal safety verification. The project implements UK traffic light standards with pedestrian crossing functionality, backed by mathematical proofs and philosophical foundations.

## 📋 Project Overview

### **System Features**
- ✅ **UK Traffic Light Standard**: Proper RED+AMBER preparation phase
- ✅ **Pedestrian Crossing**: Separate red/green pedestrian signals with democratic request processing
- ✅ **Formal Safety Verification**: Mathematically proven safe with 4 safety invariants
- ✅ **Ontological Analysis**: Comprehensive philosophical and requirements engineering
- ✅ **Educational Platform**: Suitable for Tinkercad simulation and electronics learning
- ✅ **Professional Code**: Clean, documented, maintainable implementation

### **Safety Properties (Formally Proven)**
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Traffic and pedestrian greens never simultaneous
2. **Progressive Warning**: All green→red transitions pass through amber
3. **Minimum Time Guarantee**: 3-second minimum green before interruption
4. **Deadlock Freedom**: System always progresses, never gets stuck

## 🔧 Hardware Setup

### **Pin Configuration (UK Standard)**
| Pin | Component | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 13  | Pedestrian Button | INPUT_PULLUP - Democratic participation interface |
| 12  | Red Traffic LED | OUTPUT - Universal prohibition signifier |
| 11  | Amber Traffic LED | OUTPUT - Temporal transition warning |
| 10  | Green Traffic LED | OUTPUT - Movement permission authorization |
| 9   | Pedestrian Red LED | OUTPUT - Pedestrian constraint signal |
| 8   | Pedestrian Green LED | OUTPUT - Pedestrian empowerment signal |

### **Component Requirements**
- Arduino Uno R3
- 5× LEDs (Red, Amber/Yellow, Green, Red for pedestrian, Green/White for pedestrian)
- 5× 330Ω resistors (optimized for current efficiency)
- 1× Momentary push button
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### **Current Specifications**
- **Per LED**: 6-9mA (with 330Ω resistors)
- **Total System**: ~75mA (efficient operation)
- **Safety Margin**: Well within 40mA per pin / 200mA total limits

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **For Tinkercad Simulation:**
1. Open [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)
2. Add Arduino Uno R3 and components as specified above
3. Copy code from `arduino-code/traffic-lights-arduino-clean.c`
4. Wire according to pin configuration
5. Start simulation and press pedestrian button to test

### **For Physical Arduino:**
1. Wire components according to `documentation/WIRING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Upload `arduino-code/traffic-lights-arduino-clean.c` to your Arduino
3. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) for debugging output
4. System will start with RED light and begin normal cycle

## 📊 System Behavior

### **Normal Traffic Cycle**
1. **RED** (5 seconds) - Traffic stopped
2. **RED+AMBER** (2 seconds) - Prepare to proceed
3. **GREEN** (6 seconds) - Traffic flows
4. **AMBER** (3 seconds) - Prepare to stop
5. Return to RED

### **Pedestrian Crossing Cycle**
- Button press during GREEN with >3 seconds elapsed → Immediate amber transition
- Button press during GREEN with <3 seconds elapsed → Queued until minimum time
- Button press during other states → Queued for next green cycle
- Pedestrian crossing phase: 8 seconds of safe crossing time

### **Safety Features**
- **Real-time Safety Verification**: Continuous monitoring of safety invariants
- **Emergency Response**: Automatic safe state on safety violation
- **Button Debouncing**: 200ms filter prevents false triggers
- **Non-blocking Architecture**: Responsive to all inputs
