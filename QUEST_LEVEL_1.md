# Level 1: Make One LED Blink

## What you'll do

Make one LED turn on and off.

That's it. Just one light blinking.

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

**You need:**
- Arduino
- 1√ó LED (any colour)
- 1√ó Resistor
- 2√ó Wires
- USB cable

---

## Why start here?

This is the easiest Arduino project.

If you can make one LED blink, you can control anything - traffic lights, robots, displays, everything.

Every Arduino project starts here.

---

## The steps

Follow these in order. Don't skip any.

## üéí Required Inventory

### Minimum (Hardware):
- [ ] 1√ó Arduino Uno R3
- [ ] 1√ó LED (any color, but red is traditional)
- [ ] 1√ó Resistor (220Œ© or 330Œ©)
- [ ] 2√ó Jumper wires
- [ ] 1√ó Breadboard (optional but recommended)
- [ ] 1√ó USB cable
- [ ] 1√ó Computer

### Minimum (Software):
- [ ] Arduino IDE installed (free from arduino.cc)

**Don't have hardware?** ‚Üí Try **Tinkercad Circuits** (tinkercad.com/circuits) instead - free online simulator!

---

## Step 1: Get everything ready

**Do this:**
1. Plug Arduino into computer with USB cable
2. Open Arduino IDE on computer
3. Put components on desk

**Check:** Small LED on Arduino board should light up when plugged in ‚úÖ

---

## Step 2: Connect the wires

### First: Which leg is which?

**Look at your LED:**
- LONG leg = Positive ‚úÖ
- SHORT leg = Negative (ground) ‚ùå

Can't tell? Look for the flat edge on the LED plastic = that's the negative side.

---

### Now connect it:

**1. Put LED in breadboard**
- Long leg goes in one hole
- Short leg goes in hole next to it

**2. Add the resistor**
- One end connects to LED long leg (same row)
- Other end in a different row

**3. Connect wire from Arduino Pin 13**
- Goes to the resistor

**4. Connect wire from Arduino GND**
- Goes to LED short leg

**Check:** LED not lit yet? That's correct! It will light up after we add code.

---

### Not sure about wiring?

See [BEGINNER_BUILD_GUIDE.md](BEGINNER_BUILD_GUIDE.md) for pictures and detailed wiring.

---

## Step 3: Write the code

Open Arduino IDE and copy this code:

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);

  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

**What this does:**
- `pinMode(13, OUTPUT)` = Pin 13 will control the LED
- `digitalWrite(13, HIGH)` = Turn LED ON
- `delay(1000)` = Wait 1 second
- `digitalWrite(13, LOW)` = Turn LED OFF
- Then it repeats forever

**Don't understand it?** That's okay. Just copy it exactly and it will work.

---

## Step 4: Upload to Arduino

**Do this:**

1. Click **Tools** ‚Üí **Board** ‚Üí **Arduino Uno**

2. Click **Tools** ‚Üí **Port** ‚Üí Pick the one with your Arduino

3. Click the **Upload button** (‚Üí arrow at top)

4. Wait for "Done uploading"

---

### Error: "Port not found"?

**Try these:**
- Check USB cable is plugged in properly
- Try a different USB cable (some only charge, they don't send data)
- Try a different USB port on your computer

---

## Step 5: Watch it work!

**What happens:**
- LED turns ON
- Waits 1 second
- LED turns OFF
- Waits 1 second
- Repeats forever

---

## ‚úÖ Success!

**Your LED is blinking?** You did it!

This is the foundation of everything in Arduino.

---

## Something not working?

### LED doesn't light at all:
1. Check the long leg goes to Pin 13 side
2. Push wires in firmly
3. Press the reset button on Arduino

### LED stays on forever:
1. Check your code matches exactly
2. Look for missing semicolons (;)
3. Upload the code again

### LED is very dim:
That's fine! It still counts as working.

## What you learned

You now know:
- How to connect wires to Arduino
- How to upload code
- How `pinMode` and `digitalWrite` work
- How to make something turn on and off

**This is real programming.** You're controlling hardware with code you wrote.

## üéÆ Side Quests (Optional Challenges)

Try these modifications to earn bonus experience:

### Side Quest 1: Speed Control ‚ö°
**Challenge:** Make it blink faster
**Hint:** Change `delay(1000)` to `delay(500)` (half second)
**Reward:** Understanding of timing

### Side Quest 2: Morse Code üì°
**Challenge:** Blink "SOS" in Morse code (¬∑¬∑¬∑‚àí‚àí‚àí¬∑¬∑¬∑)
