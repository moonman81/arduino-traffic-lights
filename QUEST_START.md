## 💬 Guidance from the Elder Developers

> *"Every master was once a beginner. Start with Level 1, even if you think it's too easy. Building confidence is the first step to mastery."*
> — Arduino Sensei

> *"The best path is the one you complete. Don't start at Level 3 if you haven't done Level 1. The journey teaches more than the destination."*
> — Embedded Systems Wizard

> *"It's okay to fail. Every bug you fix teaches you more than a working example."*
> — The Debugging Oracle
