# Arduino Traffic Light - Start Here

## What you're going to build

**A working traffic light.**

Press a button → pedestrian light turns green → cars stop

Just like real UK traffic lights.

---

## No experience needed

You don't need to know anything about Arduino or coding.

Everything is explained step by step.

If something doesn't work, there's a troubleshooting guide.

---

## Pick your starting point

Read the options below and pick the one that sounds like you.

---

### Level 1: Never used Arduino before

**You will:** Make one LED blink

**Time:** 10 minutes

**→ [Start Level 1](QUEST_LEVEL_1.md)**

This is the easiest starting point. If you're not sure, start here.

---

### Level 2: Done Arduino once or twice

**You will:** Make 3 LEDs work like traffic lights (red, yellow, green)

**Time:** 45 minutes

**→ [Start Level 2](QUEST_LEVEL_2.md)**

Pick this if you've made an LED blink before.

---

### Level 3: Ready for the full project

**You will:** Build the complete system with button

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**→ [Start Level 3](QUEST_LEVEL_3.md)**

Pick this if you're comfortable with Arduino and want the whole thing.

---

### Advanced: Want to understand how it works

**You will:** Learn about state machines and professional code

**Time:** Several hours

**→ [Advanced Guide](QUEST_ADVANCED.md)**

**Note:** This is harder. Better to do Level 1 or 2 first if you're new to programming.

---

### Expert: University/research level

**You will:** Study formal verification and theory

**Time:** Academic study

**→ [Expert Guide](QUEST_EXPERT.md)**

Only pick this if you're doing A-Level/university and need the deep theory.

---

## Do you have the equipment?

### ✅ Yes, I have Arduino and LEDs
Great! Pick your level above and start.

### ❌ No, I don't have equipment yet
No problem. You have two options:

**Option 1:** Use the online simulator (free, no equipment needed)
- Go to tinkercad.com/circuits
- Make a free account
- You can build everything virtually

**Option 2:** Get the equipment
See the shopping list in [BEGINNER_BUILD_GUIDE.md](BEGINNER_BUILD_GUIDE.md) Part 1

---

### What you need (if buying):
- Arduino Uno R3
- Breadboard
- 5× LEDs (any colours)
- 5× Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable
- Computer with Arduino IDE (free download)

## 💬 Guidance from the Elder Developers

> *"Every master was once a beginner. Start with Level 1, even if you think it's too easy. Building confidence is the first step to mastery."*
> — Arduino Sensei

> *"The best path is the one you complete. Don't start at Level 3 if you haven't done Level 1. The journey teaches more than the destination."*
> — Embedded Systems Wizard

> *"It's okay to fail. Every bug you fix teaches you more than a working example."*
> — The Debugging Oracle
